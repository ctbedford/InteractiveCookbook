Okay, focusing purely on the discrepancies identified between the screenshot `image_0be8a2.jpg` and our final specification, based on the codebase provided in `app_code_export (3).txt`, here are the specific changes needed:

**1. Fix Incorrect Budget in Dynamic Summary Text**

* **File:** `./client/src/components/ResultsCard.tsx`
* **Location:** Inside the `<p>` tag used for the dynamic summary text (within both the `totals` and `weekly` `TabsContent`).
* **Problem:** The text incorrectly displays a fixed budget value ($6,400.00 in a previous example, though the current code snippet uses `props.budget`) instead of dynamically using the actual budget passed in via props. The screenshot shows $50,000 budget in the summary, which *does* match the input $50,000 this time (unlike my previous analysis based on an older image/example), but the user noted it *was* wrong previously. We need to ensure it's always correct.
* **Fix:** Verify that the budget value is being interpolated using `props.budget` as shown in the current code[cite: 38, 51]: `With a <span className="font-medium">{formatCurrency(props.budget)}</span> budget...`. If this is already in place and was still showing wrong values previously, the issue might have been stale state or an error in how `budget` was passed down from `ROICalculator.tsx`. Ensure `budget` is correctly included in the `CalculationResult` return object in `calculationUtils.ts`[cite: 464] and passed in the spread props `(<ResultsCard {...results} />`) in `ROICalculator.tsx`.

**2. Fix Incorrect Formatting for "Expected Campaign Sales Per Store Per Week"**

* **File:** `./client/src/components/ResultsCard.tsx`
* **Location:** Inside the `div` displaying this metric (within `totals` `TabsContent`, line[cite: 37]).
* **Problem:** The value formatting is likely incorrect, showing `$192.31` instead of the expected `$19.23`.
* **Fix:** Modify the `formatCurrency` call for this specific value to force showing decimal places. Change:
    ```jsx
     {formatCurrency(props.expectedCampaignSalesPerStorePerWeek)}
    ```
    to:
    ```jsx
     {formatCurrency(props.expectedCampaignSalesPerStorePerWeek, true)}
    ```
    Also, double-check the `formatCurrency` function in `./client/src/lib/formatUtils.ts` to ensure `minimumFractionDigits: 2` is correctly applied when `forceDecimals` is true.

**3. Fix Incorrect Profitability Conclusion in Dynamic Summary Text**

* **File:** `./client/src/lib/calculationUtils.ts` & `./client/src/components/ResultsCard.tsx`
* **Problem:** The summary text concludes "...appears achievable and potentially profitable." which is incorrect when the user's entire lift range is below the calculated break-even lift percentage (34.5% in the `image_0be8a2.jpg` example). The summary needs logic to compare `userLiftMin`/`Max` to the `breakEvenLiftPercent`.
* **Fix:**
    * **Step 1 (Data Passing - `calculationUtils.ts`):**
        * Calculate `breakEvenLiftPercent` inside `calculateResults`:
          ```typescript
          const baselineSalesPerStorePerWeek = (heroBaseline / 52) / (stores || 1);
          const breakEvenLiftPercent = (baselineSalesPerStorePerWeek > 0) ? (adSpendPerStoreWeek / baselineSalesPerStorePerWeek) * 100 : Infinity;
          ```
        * Modify the `CalculationResult` interface to include `breakEvenLiftPercent: number;`.
        * Add `breakEvenLiftPercent` to the return object of `calculateResults`[cite: 464].
    * **Step 2 (Logic & Display - `ResultsCard.tsx`):**
        * Update `ResultsCardProps` interface to include `breakEvenLiftPercent: number;`.
        * Inside the component function[cite: 30], add logic to determine the correct conclusion:
          ```typescript
          // Inside ResultsCard component function
          const breakEvenDisplay = !isFinite(props.breakEvenLiftPercent) ? 'N/A' : `${props.breakEvenLiftPercent.toFixed(1)}%`;
          const liftRangeDisplay = `${props.userLiftMin.toFixed(1)}%-${props.userLiftMax.toFixed(1)}%`;
          let profitabilityConclusion = "";
          if (props.breakEvenLiftPercent === Infinity || props.baselineSalesPerStorePerWeek <= 0) {
             profitabilityConclusion = "Profitability cannot be assessed due to zero baseline sales.";
          } else if (props.userLiftMin >= props.breakEvenLiftPercent) {
            profitabilityConclusion = `Your target range (${liftRangeDisplay}) is above the break-even lift requirement (${breakEvenDisplay}) and appears profitable.`;
          } else if (props.userLiftMax >= props.breakEvenLiftPercent) {
            profitabilityConclusion = `Your target range (${liftRangeDisplay}) crosses the break-even lift requirement (${breakEvenDisplay}) and may be profitable if the upper lift is achieved.`;
          } else {
            profitabilityConclusion = `Your target range (${liftRangeDisplay}), while achievable, is below the break-even lift requirement (${breakEvenDisplay}) and is unlikely to cover ad spend.`; // Correct conclusion for the example image
          }
          ```
        * Modify the `<p>` tag for the dynamic summary text. Keep the first part describing budget/stores/weeks/ASW and the intensity range/icon. Replace the existing appended `props.intensityFeedback.message` with the newly generated `profitabilityConclusion` string. It might be better to append *both* the detailed intensity message *and* the specific profitability conclusion for full context:
          ```jsx
           <p className="text-sm text-primary-700 leading-relaxed">
             With a <span className="font-medium">{formatCurrency(props.budget)}</span> budget ... is in the <span className={`font-medium ${intensityColorClass}`}>{props.intensityFeedback.level.toLowerCase()}</span> range {props.intensityFeedback.icon}.
             {/* Append the detailed intensity message */}
             {" "}{props.intensityFeedback.message}
             {/* Append the accurate profitability conclusion */}
             {" "}{profitabilityConclusion}
           </p>
          ```

**4. Remove Redundant Lift Range Note (Optional)**

* **File:** `./client/src/components/ResultsCard.tsx`
* **Location:** The Notes section.
* **Problem:** A note specifying the lift range used might be redundant given the sub-label under "Expected Incremental Sales Range".
* **Fix (Optional):** Delete the line `<p className="text-xs text-primary-500">Note: All ranges shown are based on your input values (+X.X% to +Y.Y% lift).</p>` if it exists, or simply ensure the final notes only contain the essential disclaimers as shown in the last image.

Addressing these specific points in the identified files will fix the remaining gaps between the code in `app_code_export (3).txt` and the desired behavior, particularly ensuring the summary text provides an accurate assessment of profitability based on the user's inputs vs. the break-even requirement.
